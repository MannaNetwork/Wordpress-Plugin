# wordpress_plugin
Creates a complete (i.e. with categories and links) web directory on a Wordpress website. Requires registration at an active Manna Network agent website. The registration and installation process enable the site to earn BitcoinSV commissions.


Important: After creating the page where the directory will be displayed it is strongly suggested you add "<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow">" to the page's metatags. Since the purpose of distributing the directory is to have the advertoser's ads on tens/hundreds of thousands of websites, the search engines may consider each copy as "duplicate content" and might penalize the page (or your site).
