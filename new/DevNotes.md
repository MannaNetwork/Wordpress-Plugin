Have css issues between different themes. The include(stsyles.css line on mannanetwork-main.php page line 37 is commented out so the plugin is currently using the default css of whatever theme is being run. IF that css is uncommented, it causes the pages loaded by the paginator buttons (on displays of results greater than 20 links) to display the description part with white text (rendering them invisible until moused over)
