# Manna Network Distributed, Co-operative Yellow Pages Style Web Directory
Creates a complete (i.e. with categories and links) web directory on a Wordpress website. Requires registration at an active Manna Network agent website (visit Manna-Network.com/register for list of available registration sites). The installation of this script enables the site to earn BitcoinSV commissions.

Important: After creating the page where the directory will be displayed it is strongly suggested you add "<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow">" to the page's metatags (in the header). This is to prevent the search engines from mistakenly considering each copy as "duplicate content" (which might cause the page or site to be penalized in the rankings).

Installation: Download the plugin from either GitHub (https://github.com/MannaNetwork/Wordpress-Plugin) or the Wordpress Repository (coming soon) to your local drive. Login to your Wordpress dashboard, click "Plugins" and follow the typical plugin installation procedure (i.e. upload the files to your installation's wp-content/plugins folder, activate it from the dashboard etc.).
Create a page on your site titled something like "Directory" or "Advertise" and add the shortag [mannanetwork] to activate the plugin. You will now have a "MannaNetwork" button in your Dashboard (left column). Click that and your plugin should configure itself and make the connections to the Manna Network Co-operative (save the configurations). 

That should be it! Visit the page and you should now have a complete (with categories, links and management) web directory on your site where your visitors can register for advertising across the whole network.
